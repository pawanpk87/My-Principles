# A simple solution is better than a complex one, even if the solution looks stupid.

The KISS principle is about striving for simplicity. The KISS principle states that a solution is better when it uses less inheritance, less polymorphism, fewer classes, etc.

A solution that follows the KISS principle might look boring or even “stupid” but simple and understandable. The KISS principle states that there is no value in a solution being “clever” but being easily understandable.

This does not mean that features like inheritance and polymorphism should not be used at all. Rather they should only be used when they are necessary or there is some substantial advantage.

Rationale
A simpler solution is better than a complex one because simple solutions are easier to maintain. This includes increased readability, understandability, and changeability. Furthermore, writing simple code is less error-prone.
